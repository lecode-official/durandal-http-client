# Durandal HTTP Client

A simple HTTP client for calling RESTful APIs written in TypeScript. This HTTP client is made to be used in conjunction with the Durandal SPA application framework. Since the Durandal framework is no longer being actively developed and has been superseded by Aurelia, this project is also no longer active.
